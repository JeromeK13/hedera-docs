# Introduction

Through this short coding series, you will learn the basics of creating an account, transferring _**HBAR**_, signing, and submitting transactions to the _**Hedera Testnet**_. The Hedera test network allows you to play with our APIs in a non-production environment. You will see how easy it is to get started with one of our Hedera SDKs in the programming language of your choice. First, you need to create a Hedera Portal profile to get test _**HBAR**_.

### Create Hedera Developer Portal Profile (Faucet)

You will need a Hedera Testnet account. The _**Hedera Testnet**_ account allows you to interact with our APIs and pay for the transaction fees. Visit the [Hedera portal](https://portal.hedera.com/register) to create your _Hedera Testnet_ account and follow the instructions.

Once you have completed the instructions, you will receive a _Hedera Testnet_ _**account ID**_ (0.0.x) and your _**private/public key pair**_ on your testnet page. You will need to copy over your _account ID_ and _key pair_ information when you set up your coding environment in the following steps.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Note:** Your Hedera Testnet account will be credited with 10,000 test **HBAR** upon creation that can only be utilized on the Hedera test network. Your balance will be topped up daily to 10,000 test **HBAR** when you use your funds._
{% endhint %}

Next, you will set up your coding environment.
